# What is MorphL

MorphL is an open-source initiative that uses machine learning to predict users' behavior in mobile & web applications and enable personalized user experiences to increase engagement & conversion rates. Morphl.io is funded through [Google Digital News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/dnifund/) (‚Ç¨ 50,000 grant).

The product development process usually consists of a few important phases: <strong>planning</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, <strong>development</strong> and <strong>launch</strong>. To increase engagement and conversion rates, this process undergoes multiple iterations which developers seldom navigate by looking at the data. Usually there‚Äôs somebody else, be it a product owner, marketing or sales person, analyzing it and feeding developers a feature list needed for the next product release.

There lies the gap between developers, marketers and users which leads to lots of guess-work. Consequently, the product development feedback loop is broken.

MorphL uses machine learning to optimize user interactions by <strong>analyzing product micro-metrics</strong> and enabling automatic user interface adaptation to provide a <strong>personalized user experience</strong>.

# Get early access

On-premises, Cloud, or Hybrid. We offer several deployment options, giving you the flexibility to leverage MorphL based on the model that best suits your business needs and your budget.

If you run a business and are planning on using MorphL in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor MorphL development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. It can also help your exposure in the open-source community and makes it easier to attract developers.

# Architecture

The MorphL Platform consists of two main components:

- **[MorphL Platform Orchestrator](orchestrator/)** - This is the backbone of the platform. It sets up the infrastructure required for running pipelines for each model.

- **[MorphL Pipelines](pipelines/)** - Consists of various Python scripts, required for retrieving data from various sources, pre-processing, training a model and generating predictions.

---

The code that you'll find in this repository is a mirror that we use for making releases. If you want to contribute to a pipeline or create a new model, please open a pull request in the corresponding repository from the [MorphL-AI organization](https://github.com/Morphl-AI).
